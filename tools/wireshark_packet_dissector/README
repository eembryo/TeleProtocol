* Wireshark packet dissector for IP Command Protocol
This script considers the packets, which are transported over UDP port 50000, as IP
command messages. And It analyzes PDU header from the packets: payload is not supported, yet.

* Usage
Before you apply this script, you may have to capture IP command messages using tcpdump.

$ wireshark -X lua_script:ipcomm_dissector.lua <tcpdump file>
