* HOW TO COMPILE *
1. get whole source of wireshark
2. extract it (let's call it ${WIRESHARK_ROOT})
3. copy plugin source into ${WIRESHARK_ROOT}/plugins
4. open ${WIRESHARK_ROOT}/CMakeLists.txt file
5. append "ipcmd" to "set(PLUGIN_SRC_DIRS ...)" in the CMakeLists.txt
6. make a build directory (for example, mkdir ${WIRESHARK_ROOT}/build)
7. change directory to ${WIRESHARK_ROOT}/build
8. type "cmake ${WIRESHARK_ROOT}"
9. make (will take long time)
10. You will get a compiled plugin (e.g ${WIRESHARK_ROOT}/build/run/ipcmd.so)

* HOW TO APPLY *
1. copy ipcmd.so into "${HOME}/.config/wireshark/plugins/"
2. enable following line in ipcmd_dissector.lua if it was disabled
	- ipcmd_pl_dt = DissectorTable.get("ipcmd_payload")
2. run wireshark with lua_script (e.g wireshark -X lua_script:./ipcmd_dissector.lua dump.pcap)
